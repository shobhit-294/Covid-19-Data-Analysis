# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
Covid-19 Data Analysis This project focuses on the analysis of Covid-19 data to gain insights and understand the impact of the pandemic. It aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of various aspects related to the spread, trends, and effects of the virus.
# Key Features:
Data Collection: The project gathers Covid-19 data from reliable sources, including national and international health organizations, government reports, and reputable data repositories.

Data Preprocessing: The collected data is processed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. This includes handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through EDA techniques, the project uncovers patterns, trends, and correlations within the data. It includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and interactive dashboards to present the findings.

# Analysis and Results:
After the completion of 6 weeks training in Data Science, we are able to: 
• RECALL – Recall the topics like :- Basic of python and basic of statistics (which 
includes mean, mode , median, variance, etc.). 
• UNDERSTAND – Understand the topic of Data Science which includes various steps 
such as data extraction, data cleaning and applying appropriate model by which we 
can make future predictions. 
• APPLY – After understanding the concept of Data Science we are able to apply the 
data science concept to various problems. 

# Technologies Used:
The project is developed using various technologies and tools, including:

Programming Languages: Python
Data Manipulation and Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
